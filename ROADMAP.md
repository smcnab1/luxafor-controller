# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines planned improvements for the Luxafor Controller Raycast extension.

## Near-term
- Preferences: Default startup color and optional blink duration
- Menubar: Add custom hex colors and recent colors
- Command: Quick-actions command for frequently used colors
- Error handling: Friendly error screens and retry suggestions

## Mid-term
- Color presets: Named presets with multi-step sequences
- Scenes: Timed patterns or daily schedules (requires local scheduler)
- Bluetooth variants: Surface device-specific notes for BT devices
- Status persistence: Optional local cache to restore last color on reboot

## Long-term
- Multi-device support (select device where applicable)
- Workspace integrations (Slack, Calendar) to set presence via webhooks
- CI/CD: Automated release workflow to Raycast Store

Suggestions and PRs welcome!
